#Voice controlled connected home

Increasingly, more devices have started supporting network capability. This allows one to control these devices using a browser or an app on a mobile. However, this poses another problem - multitude of interfaces to control large number of devices. This project aims to bind all these together in a single unified voice controlled interface.

The [demo] (http://youtu.be/VojVL8AbNq8) consists of a voice activated Android app controlling Spark core enabled switches, IP camera, XBMC media devices, Raspberry Pi and Denon AVR. Some highlights:
* Say “let there be light” or “lights on” to switch on lights
*	Say “Watch TV” to watch TV
*	Say “Play radio” to listen to FM radio
*	Say “Volume up/down”, “volume mute/unmute” to control volume
*	Say “lights off” to turn off lights
*	Say “show front door” to view the activity in front door via an IP camera
*	Say “play song” to play a song from one’s music library
*	Say “play movie batman” to play Batman movie in one’s movie library
*	Say “pause/play” to control media playback
*	Pause media in one room and resume the same in another room
